the date of such vesting, be deemed to have become the lessee of the State Government as if a mining
lease under the Mineral Concession Rules had been granted by the State Government to the Central
Government, the period thereof being the entire period for which such a lease could have been granted
by the State Government under those rules. 11. Power of Central Government to direct vesting of land or
rights in a Government company.—(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 10, the Central

that the land or the rights in or over the land, as the case may be, shall, instead of vesting in the Central
Government under section 10 or continuing to so vest, vest in the Government company either on the
date of publication of the declaration or on such other date as may be specified in the direction. (2)

Compensation for prospecting licences ceasing to have effect, rights under mining leases being acquired,
etc.—(1) Where a prospecting licence ceases to have effect under section 5, there shall be paid to the

works on the land, if such roads or works are in existence and in a usable condition; (iv) the expenditure, if any, incurred in respect of any other operation necessary for prospecting carried out in the land. (2)
Where the rights under a mining lease are acquired under this Act, there shall be paid to the person
interested compensation, the amount of which shall be a sum made up of the following items, namely,—

respect to the matters specified in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of sub-section (1) before the date of the
lease: 1. Subs. by Act 51 of 1957, s. 5, for “granted by a State Government” (w.e.f. 12-6-1957). 5 Provided
that where two or more leases had been granted in relation to any land covered previously by one
prospecting licence, only so much of the expenditure aforesaid as bears to the total expenditure the same
proportion as the area under the mining lease in respect of which the rights have been acquired bears to
the total area covered by the mining leases shall be payable under this clause; (ii) any reasonable and
bona fide expenditure of the nature referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of sub-section (1) actually

interest being calculated in the following manner, that is to say,— interest at the rate of five per centum
per annum in respect of the expenditure incurred during each calendar year for the first five years
commencing from the year in which such expenditure was incurred plus interest at the rate of four per
centum per annum in respect of each subsequent year after the expiration of the first five years and
ending with the year in which the rights under the lease are acquired: Provided that the total sum payable under this clause shall not exceed one-half of the total amount referred to in 2[clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)]. (3)
Where the rights under a mining lease acquired under section 9 relate only to a part of the land covered
by the mining lease, the amount of compensation payable shall be such as bears to the total
compensation which would have been payable if the rights of the mining lessee in respect of the entire
land had been acquired, the same proportion which the area of the land in respect of which the rights are
acquired bears to the total area of the land covered by the mining lease. (4) Where a mining lease ceases
to have effect for any period under clause (b) of section 5, there shall be paid by way of compensation for
the period during which the lease so ceased to have effect, a sum equivalent to five per centum of any
such expenditure as is referred to in clauses (i) and (iii) of sub-section (2) for each year during which the
lease remains suspended. (5) Where any land is acquired under section 9, there shall be paid
compensation to the person interested the amount of which shall be determined after taking into

sub-section (1) of section 4; Explanation.—The value of any minerals lying in the land shall not be taken
into consideration in determining the market value of any land; (b) the damage sustained by the person
interested, by reason of the taking of any standing crops or trees which may be on the land at the time of
the taking possession thereof; (c) the damage, if any, sustained by the person interested, at the time of
taking possession of the land, by reason of severing such land from other land; (d) the damage, if any,
sustained by the person interested, at the time of taking possession of the land, by reason of the
acquisition injuriously affecting his other immovable property in any other manner, or his earnings; (e) if,
in consequence of the acquisition of the land, the person interested is compelled to change his residence
or place of business, the reasonable expenses, if any, incidental to such change; and 1. Subs. by Act 51 of
1957, s. 6, for “during the period commencing from the date of the lease and ending with” (w.e.f. 12-6-
1957). 2. Subs. by s. 6, ibid., for “clauses (ii) and (iii)” (w.e.f. 12-6-1957). 6 (f) the damage, if any, bona fide
resulting from diminution of the profits of the land between the time of the publication of the notification under sub-section (1) of section 4 and the time of the publication of the declaration under sub-section (2)
of section 9. 1[(5A) In determining the amount of compensation for any land acquired under section 9,
any increase to the value of the other land of the person interested, likely to accrue from the use to which
the land acquired will be put shall not be taken into consideration.] (6) Where any operation carried on by
or on behalf of the Central Government in the exercise of any powers conferred by this Act causes or is
likely to cause damage to the surface of any land or any works thereon and in respect thereof no provision for compensation is made elsewhere in this Act, the competent authority shall pay or tender payment for
all such damage, and, in case of dispute as to the sufficiency of the amount so paid or tendered or as to
the person to whom it is to be paid or tendered, he shall refer the dispute to the decision of the Tribunal.
(7) No compensation under this section in relation to maps, charts and other documents shall be paid
unless the person to whom it is payable has delivered to the prescribed authority all the maps, charts and
other documents. 14. Method of determining compensation.—(1) Where the amount of any
compensation payable under this Act can be fixed by agreement, it shall be paid in accordance with such
agreement. (2) Where no such agreement can be reached, the Central Government shall constitute a
Tribunal consisting of a person who is or has been or is qualified to be a Judge of a High Court for the
purpose of determining the amount. (3) The Central Government may in any particular case nominate a
person having expert knowledge in mining to assist the Tribunal, and where such nomination is made, the
person or persons interested may also nominate any other person for the same purpose. (4) At the
commencement of the proceedings before the Tribunal the Central Government and the person
interested shall state what in their respective opinions is a fair amount of compensation. (5) The Tribunal
shall after hearing the dispute, make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears
to it to be just, and specify the person or persons to whom the compensation shall be paid; and in making
the award the Tribunal shall have regard to the circumstances of each case and to the foregoing provisions of this Act with respect to the manner in which the amount of compensation shall be determined in so far
as the said provisions or any of them may be applicable. (6) Where there is a dispute as to the person or
persons entitled to compensation and the Tribunal finds that more persons than one are entitled to
compensation, it shall apportion the amount thereof among such persons and in such manner as it thinks
fit. (7) Nothing in the Arbitration Act, 1940 (10 of 1940), shall apply to any proceedings under this section.

the sum which in the opinion of the Tribunal ought to have been awarded as compensation is in excess of
the sum which the Central Government has stated to be a fair amount of compensation, the award of the
Tribunal may direct that the Central Government shall pay interest on such excess at the rate of five per
centum per annum from the date on which it became payable to the date of payment of such excess. 17.
Payment of compensation.—(1) Any compensation payable under this Act may be tendered or paid to the
persons interested entitled thereto, and the Central Government shall pay it to them unless prevented by
some one or more of the contingencies mentioned in sub-section (2). (2) If the persons interested entitled thereto shall not consent to receive it or if there be any dispute as to the sufficiency of the amount of
compensation or the title to receive it or the apportionment thereof, the Central Government shall
deposit the amount of compensation with the Tribunal: Provided that any person admitted to be
interested may receive such payment under protest as to the sufficiency of the amount: 1 [Provided

to be interested or not) including the person referred to in the preceding proviso shall be entitled to prefer a claim for compensation before the Tribunal: Provided also that no person who has received the amount
otherwise than under protest shall be entitled to prefer any such claim before the Tribunal.] (3) When the
amount of compensation is not paid or deposited as required by this section, the Central Government
shall be liable to pay interest thereon at the rate of five per centum per annum from the time the
compensation became due until it shall have been so paid or deposited. 18. Prospecting and mining to be
done by Central Government in conformity with the Mineral Concession Rules.—Where prospecting is
done under this Act by or on behalf of the Central Government in any land situate within the jurisdiction
of a State Government or where the Central Government or a Government company has become the
lessee of a State Government in respect of any land under this Act, the terms and conditions under which
the prospecting can be done or rights under the lease exercised shall, as far as may be, be the same as the terms and conditions applicable to prospecting licences and mining leases under the Mineral Concession
Rules; and in case of doubt or dispute, shall be settled by arbitration or in such other manner as the
Central Government and the State Government may decide. 2 [18A. Payment to State Governments in lieu of royalty.—Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, where any land or any rights in or over land
belonging to a State Government (other than the rights under a mining lease granted or deemed to have
been granted by the State Government to any person) vest in the Central Government under section 10 or in a Government Company under section 11, the Central Government or the Company, as the case may
be, may pay to the State Government such sum of money as would have been payable as royalty by a
lessee had such land or rights been under a mining lease granted by the State Government.] 19. Power to
delegate.—The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, direct that all or any of the powers or duties which may be exercised or discharged by it under this Act shall, in such circumstances

any 2[mine], for any reason, are extended or get extended within any shorter distance than what is laid
down herein above, the Chief Inspector may, by an order in writing, require the owner to construct such
protective works within such time as he may specify in the order]. 3[(3)] Notwithstanding anything
contained in sub-regulation (1), the Chief Inspector may, by an order in writing and subject to such
conditions as he may specify therein, permit the workings of any mine or part thereof to extend within
any shorter distance than 7.5 metres aforesaid, or may require that the said working shall not extend
further than a specified distance, not exceeding 60 metres, of such boundary. 112. Support of workings. –
(1) The roof or back, hanging wall, footwall and sides of every roadway and working place, including
airways and travelling roadways to second outlets, shall be made and kept secure. (2)(a) If the Regional
Inspector is of the opinion with respect to any mine or part thereof that systematic support for the roof or back hanging wall, footwall and sides, or either, or them, ought to be provided an maintained for the
purpose of securing the safety of persons employed therein, he may serve upon the owner, agent or
manager an order in writing specifying the mine or part, stating that he is of opinion aforesaid and
requiring the provision and maintenance of support in accordance with a code of Timbering Rules which
he may specify in the order. (b)The manager shall hand over copies of the code of Timbering Rules to the
assistant manager, the underground manager and to all other supervising officials concerned, and shall
also post such copies at conspicuous places in the mine. (c) The manager, assistant manager, underground manager and such supervising officials shall be responsible for securing effective compliance with the
provisions of the Timbering Rules, an the mine or part thereof shall not be worked in contravention
thereof. 113. Setting of supports. – (1) Every piece fo timber used as a support shall be set securely and on a secure foundation an whenever it becomes loose or broken shall, as soon as possible, be tightened or
replace. (3) Every crib set or pigstye used as a support shall be well built on a secure foundation, and shall
be made and kept tight. Only rectangular pieces of material shall be used as members of a crib set or
pigstye; so however that in case of timber it shall be sufficient o joggle two opposite sides to provide flat
surfaces. (4) The sides of every pack used for the purpose of support shall be well built on secure
foundation. The pack shall be filled with debris or other suitable incombustible material, if so required by
the Regional Inspector as shall be made as tight as practicable over its whole area. (5) Where sand or
other material is stowed for the purpose of support, it shall be paced tight. (6) Except where it is no longer necessary for purposes of support, any support dislodged by or removed for any operation shall be
replaced with the least possible delay. (7) In every place wherein a fall of ground involving the
displacement or breakage of supports has occurred, no work of clearing the fall or any part thereof shall
be undertaken until the newly exposed roof or back hanging wall, footwall or side has been examined and
made safe- if necessary, by temporary supports. 114. Steep workings – (1) In workings having an
inclination of 30 degrees or more from the horizontal adequate precautions shall be taken to prevent
danger to persons from falling or rolling of timber, tools or other appliances or material. (2) No person
shall work or be permitted to work at any place having an inclination of 45 degrees or more from the
horizontal, where he is likely to slip or overbalance, unless he is secured by a safety belt or life line or is
otherwise safeguarded. 115. Fencing and gates – (1)(a) Unless otherwise permitted by the Chief Inspector
by an order in writing and subject to such conditions as he may specify the top of every opencast working
shall be kept securely fenced. (b) Where an excavation which has been formed as a result of any mining
operation, extends within a distance of 15 metres from a public road or any building, substantial fencing
shall be erected and maintained around the excavation. (c) Where as a result of mining operations, a
subsidence of the surface has taken place or is likely to take place and persons are likely to be endangered thereby, the owner, agent or manager shall keep the entire surface area securely and effectively fenced.
(2) Every entrance to a shaft, winze, ore-pass, chute sump, store or other dangerous place shall be
provided with an efficient fence, barrier or gate, so designed and constructed as to effectively prevent any
person from entering or falling therein. (3) Where a shaft , winze rise, chute, ore-pass or stope leads
directly into a working place or travelling roadway, such place or roadway and any working place situated
on its dip side, shall be securely guarded or otherwise protected as to prevent danger to persons from
falling materials. (4) Every entrance from a roadway in a mine to a part of the mine which, for the time
being, is neither being worked nor being used for any purpose, by reason of any cause whatsoever, shall
be provided with a fence, barrier or gate so designed and constructed as to prevent any person from
inadvertently entering that part of the mine. (5) (a) Shaft and opencast workings temporarily or
permanently out of use and any place in or about an excavation which is dangerous shall be completely
filled in or kept securely fenced: Provided that if in the opinion of the Regional Inspector, any disused
trench, pit or other excavation is dangerous, he may, by an order in writing, require the same to be filled
in to the level of the adjacent ground. (b) Before a mine is abandoned or the working thereof
discontinued, the owner, agent or manager shall cause the top or entrance of every shaft, incline or other
opening into the mine to be fenced by a structure of a permanent character sufficient effectively to
prevent persons falling into or entering the same. 116. Examination by mining mate – (1) Every place in a
mine, whether belowground or in opencast working including travelling roadways and landings, where
work is carried on or where persons are stationed or required to pass shall be placed under the charge of
a mining mate or other competent person. (2) The mine or district assigned to a mining mate or other
competent person shall not be of such a size, nor shall any additional duties other than his duties under
the regulations be such, as to be likely to prevent him from carrying out in a thorough manner the duties
prescribed for him under the regulations. If any doubt arises as to the foregoing, it shall be referred to the
Chief Inspector for decision. (3)(a) At the entrance to every mine or district, one ore more stations shall be fixed by the manager; and except in the case of a mine working in a continuous succession of shifts no
person other the persons making the examination under clause (b) or an official shall pass beyond any
such station until all the roadways and working places to which such persons are required to have access,
have been examined by the competent person in charge of the mine or district and found to be
satisfactorily ventilated and in safe condition. Every such station shall be legibly marked ‘STATION’ and
shall be of such a size as to accommodate all the persons employed in the district in any one shift. (d) The
mining mate or other competent person accompanied by such assistants as may be required shall, within
two hours before the connection of work in a shift, inspect every part of the mine or district assigned to
him, in which persons have to work or pass during the shift and all roadways and working places where
work is temporarily stopped and shall ascertain the condition thereof as regards ventilation, sanitation,
the presence of gases, the state of the roof and sides, presence of spontaneous heating and other fire
risks, and generally so far as the safety of the persons is concerned. Provided that in the case of a mine or
part to which regulation 142 applies, such inspection shall be made with an approved flame safety lamp;
an that in the case of a mine or part to which regulation 123(1) applies, a cage containing suitable birds or
other means of detecting carbon monoxide gas approved by the Chief Inspector shall be carried during
every such inspection. (e) Similar inspections shall be made once at least in every four hours during which
the shift continues, of all the roadways and other working places to which persons engaged in the mine or
district are required to have access; (f) The mining mate or other competent person shall, at the
completion of his shift, record without delay the result of his inspections in a bound paged book kept for
the purpose. Every such report shall be a full and accurate report of the inspections and shall include the
following. (i) the details referred to in clause (b); (ii) the number of persons working under his charge; (iii)
such instructions for the purposes of securing the safety of the persons as he may have given during his
shift; and (iv) the date and time of the inspections, the signature of the mining mate or other competent
person, and the date and time when the report was written. (g) In case of a mine where any other system
of examination of working places has been in force, the Chief Inspector may, by an order in writing and
subject to such conditions as he may specify therein, permit such a system to be continued in lieu of the
system of examination laid down in this subregulation. (12)In the case of a shaft in the course of being
sunk, the competent person or chargeman shall – (a) have entire charge of the shaft bottom and shall, in
his shift, remain in the shaft while persons are at work at the bottom of the shaft. He shall be the last
person to ascend the shaft at the end of the shift and if his shift is succeeded immediately by another
shift, he shall not leave the bottom of the shaft until after the descent of the chargeman of the succeeding shaft; and (b) after each round of shots, and at the beginning of every shift, and after every cessation of
work in the shaft for a period exceeding two hours, shall examine the sides of the shaft and remove all
loose pieces before persons are allowed to descend. 114. Avoidance of dangers – (1) If at any time it is
found by a competent person in charge of a mine or district, that by reason of any cause whatsoever, the
mine or district is dangerous, he shall immediately withdraw all persons from the mine or district; and the
mine or district shall be fenced off so as to prevent persons inadvertently entering therein. (2) The
competent person shall also immediately inform the manager or under-manager or assistant manager
about the danger, and shall record the fact in the book kept under sub-regulation (3). (3) The manager or
assistant manager or underground manager shall make, or cause to be made by a competent person, a
careful examination of the mine or district; and no person shall, except in so far as is necessary for
enquiring into the cause of the danger or for the removal thereof or for exploration, be re - admitted into
the mine or district until the mine or district is reported to be safe. A report of every such examination
shall be recorded without delay in a bound paged book kept for the purpose and shall be signed and
dated by the person who made the examination. (4) If the work of removing the danger is suspended
before the danger is removed, the mine or district shall be securely fenced off effectively to prevent
persons entering therein during the period of suspension. (13) Notwithstanding anything contained in
these regulations – (a) where the danger arises from the presence of inflammable or noxious gas, the
provisions of regulation 141 shall apply; and (b) where the appearance in any part of amine of smoke or
other sign indicates that a fire or spontaneous heating has or may have broken out the provisions of
regulation 12 0 shall apply. 118. General precautions – (1) Where several persons are working together in
any place, one of them shall be placed in charge. N person shall be so appointed unless he is 21 years of
age and has had not less than three years’ experience in the workings of a mine. (2) No person shall work
in any place other than his authorised working place. (3) Every person shall carefully examine his working
place before commencing work and also at intervals during the shift. If any dangerous conditions is
observed, he shall cease all work at that place and shall either take immediate steps to remove such
danger or inform an official or the competent person in charge of the mine or district. Where several
persons are working together and one of them is in charge, the examination required by this subregulation shall be made by the person in charge. (4) No person shall work or travel on any ledge or
footpath less than 1.5 metres wide, from which he will be likely to fall more than 1.8 metres, unless he is
protected by guard rails, fence or rope suitably fixed and sufficiently strong to prevent him from falling. (5) (a) No person shall carry or be permitted to carry any load along a road or footpath having an inclination
of 30 degrees or more from the horizontal. (b) Every road or footpath, along which loads are carried by
human agency, shall comply with the following requirements - (i) its breadth shall not be less than one
metre; and (ii) at every place where the inclination exceeds 15 degrees from the horizontal, level steps
shall be provided such that the vertical height of every step does not exceed 0.20 metre and the distance
from the edge to the back is not less than 0.35 metre. Explanation – Gang-planks used for loading
purposes shall not be deemed to be part of a footpath for the purposes of this sub-regulation, provided
that every gang-plank shall be so inclined or constructed as to give a secure foot-hold. (6) No person shall
be employed to lift, carry or move a load so heavy as is likely to cause bodily injury or injury to health of
that person. In case of any doubt as to whether risk of bodily injury or injury to health is involved, it shall
be referred to the Chief Inspector for decision. (8) Every person shall ensure that tools, wood, stones, or
other articles are not put down or allowed to remain, in or near a shaft , winze or opening into a stope
where work is going on, in such position as may result in their falling into the shaft, winze, or stope, as the
case may be. (8) No person shall cast nay material down any chute, pass or stope or other place until he
has assured himself that no person is in the way. (9) No person shall work or be permitted to work alone
in any remote part of a mine where, in any accident occurred he would not soon be discovered or
assisted. (10) No inexperienced person shall be employed in the mine for any work whereby he or other
persons can be seriously endangered, except under the supervision and guidance of an experienced
person. CHAPTER XII – Precautions against Dangers from Fire, Dust, Gas and Water 119. Precautions

spontaneous heating belowground or the spread of fire to the mine from any adjoining mine; and
adequate steps shall be taken to control or isolate any such fire or heating that may occur. Where in the
opinion of the Regional Inspector the provisions of this clause have not been complied with or the steps
so taken are inadequate, he may, by an order in writing, require such aditional precautions or steps to be
taken within such time as he may specify therein. If any such order is not complied with within the
specified period, the Regional Inspector may prohibit until the order has been complied with, the
employment in the mine or part, of any person whose employment is not, in his opinion, necessary for
the purpose of complying with the order. 120.Precautions after a fire has broken out – (1) (a) On the
appearance in any part of a mine of smoke or other signs indicating that a fire or spontaneous heating has or may have broken out, all persons other than those whose presence in the mine is deemed necessary
for dealing with the fire or heating shall be immediately withdrawn from the mine. No person, other than
those required for dealing with or sealing off the fire or heating, shall be admitted in the mine until the
fire or heating has been extinguished or effectively sealed off and an examination has been made by the
manager or by the assistant manager or underground manager and the mine has been declared to be
safe. A report of every such examination shall be recorded in a bound paged book kept for the purpose
and shall be signed and dated by the person making the examination : Provided that the Regional
Inspector may, by an order in writing and subject to such conditions as he may specify therein, permit the
employment in the mine, of persons other than those required to deal with the fire or heating. (b) The
examination required by clause (a) shall be made with a cage contain in suitable birds or other means of

refill it as often as may be necessary to ensure that it is in proper working order. A report of every such
examination or refilling shall be kept in a bound paged book kept for the purpose, and shall be signed and
dated by the person making the examination or refilling. 122. Apparatus for testing for Carbon Monoxide –In every mine to which regulation 123 (1) and 142 apply there shall be kept at the mine, constantly
available for use, two or more suitable birds or other means of detecting carbon monoxide gas approved
by the Chief Inspector : Provided that the Regional Inspector may, by an order in writing, require
compliance with this regulation in case of any other mine also. 123. Precautions when a fire exists
belowground . – (1) In every mine in which a fire of spontaneous heating exists in workings belowground
(whether such fire has been isolated by means of suitable seals or not), no work whatsoever shall be done in any part or section adjacent to the part or section on fire or believed to be on fire, except with the
permission in writing of the Chief Inspector and subject to such conditions as he may specify therein. (2)
In every mine to which sub-regulation (1) and regulation 142 apply, arrangements shall be made, once at
least in every 30 days, to ascertain the atmospheric conditions behind the seals of an area of old workings
or a fire or spontaneous heating unless such seals are capable of resisting the force of an explosion :
Provided that the Chief Inspector may, by an order in writing and subject to such conditions as he may
specify therein, exempt any mine or part thereof from the operation of this sub-regulation where in his
opinion special difficulties exist which make compliance with provisions thereof not reasonably
practicable. (4) (a) Every seal erected to isolate or control a fire or spontaneous heating belowground shall be numbered, and shall be of adequate strength and shall be so maintained as to prevent any leakage of
air or gas through it. Where water is likely to accumulate behind any such stopping, there shall be
provided in the stopping a suitable pipe or other device to drain away the water without permitting any

complied with or where in the opinion of the Regional Inspector the steps so taken are inadequate, he
may give notice in writing to the owner, agent or manager requiring him to take such protective measures, within such time, as he may specify therein. In case of non-compliance with the requirements of the
notice, the Regional Inspector may, by an order in writing, prohibit until the requirements of the notice
have been complied with to his satisfaction, the employment in the mine or part, of any person whose
employment is not, in his opinion, necessary for the purpose of complying with the requirements
aforesaid. (4)A competent person shall, once at least in every seven days, inspect all seals erected to
isolate or control a fire or spontaneous heating belowground. During every such inspection, he shall
ascertain the general condition of every seal, check it for leakage and presence of gas and ascertain the
temperature and humidity of the atmosphere outbye the seal. For every seal, he shall place his signature,
with date, on a check-board provided for the purpose at a suitable position on the seal; and this record
shall be maintained for a period of not less than three months A report of every such inspection shall also
be recorded in a bound paged book kept for the purpose an shall be signed and dated by the person
making the inspection : Provided that the Regional Inspector may, by an order in writing, require such
inspection to be made at such shorter intervals as he may specify therein. 1124. Precautions against dust.
– (1) The owner, agent or manager of every mine shall take such steps as are necessary for the minimising
of emissions of dust and for the suppression of dust which enters the air at any work place belowgsroud
or on surface and for ensuring that the exposure of workers to respirable dust is limited to an extent that
is reasonably practicable but in any cast not exceeding the limits that ae harmful to the health of persons.
(2) For the purpose of this regulation, a place shall not be deemed to be in a harmless state for person to
work or pass or be therein, if the 8 hours time – weighted average concentration of airborne respirable
dust – (i) in milligrams per cubic metre of air sampled by a gravimetric dust sampler of a type approved by
and determined in accordance with the procedure as specified by the Chief Inspector by a general or
special order, exceeds five in case of manganese ore and the value arrived at by dividing the figures of
fifteen with the percentage of free respirable silica present in other cases; or (ii) in case of respirable
asbestos fibres, exceeds tow fibres per mililitre of air sampled by an open membrance filter and measured by a phase contrast optical microscope of a type approved by and in accordance with the procedure as
specified by the Chief Inspector or by a general or special order. Explanation – For the purpose of this
regulation, the term “respirable asbestos fibre” means any fibrous form of mineral silicates of chrysolite,
actionolite, amosite, anthophyllite, crocidolite, tremolite or any admixure threof with a length of greater
than 5 micrometres and a diameter of less than 3 micrometres and a length to – diameter ratio greater
than three is to one. (3) (a) The owner, agent or manger of every mine shall, within six months of the
coming into force of the Metalliferous Mines (Amendment) Regulations, 1988 and once at least every six
months thereafter or whenever the Regional Inspector so requires by an order in writing, cause the air at
every work place where airborne dust is generated to be sampled and the concentration of respirable dust therein determined : Provided that, if any measurement at any workplace shows the concentration in
excess of fifty percent or seventy five percent of the allowable concentration as specified in
subregulation(2) (hereinafter referred to as ‘permissible limit’) the subsequent measurements shall be
carried on at intervals not exceeding three months or one month respectively : Provided further that, such measurements shall also be carried on immediately upon the commissioning of any plant, equipment or
machinery or upon the introduction of any new work practice or upon any alteration therein that is likely
to bring about any substantial change in the level of airborne respirable dust. (b) The location, frequency,
timing, duration and pattern of sampling shall be such that the samples drawn are, as far as practicable,
truly representative of the levels of dust exposure of work persons, and he sampling shall include – (i)
‘static monitoring’ to identify sources of dust emission and levels of dust concentration in working
environment ; and (ii) ‘personal monitoring’ of air reaching the breathing zone of work persons. The
sampling shall be duly supplemented by short-term sampling during peak-emissions. (c)Samples shall be
taken – (i) by a person who has been specially trained for the purpose; and (ii) by the sampling equipment and accessories that have bee checked to ensure correct maintenance and efficient operation thereof and
examined, tested and calibrated on a date which is not earlier than one yar. (d) Respirable dust content of
the samples and quartz content shall be determined as soon as practicable at a properly equipped
laboratory approved in writing by the Chief Inspector in that behalf. (e) All result of measurements of
airborne respirable dust and all other relevant particulars shall be systematically recorded within fourteen
days of the date of collection of samples, in a bound paged book kept for the purpose. Every entry in the
book aforesaid shall be countersigned and dated by the manager within twenty four hours after such
recording. (4)When the dust monitoring results have established that the permissible limit of dust concen
trations being exceeded at any place, the relevant operation or operations causing excessive dust shall
cease. The operation or operations shall not be resumed and allowed to be carried on until improvements have been made in the prevention and suppression of dust and fresh sampling carried out immediately on resumption of the said operation or operations has established that such improvements have reduced the
dust concentration below the ‘permissible limit’ : Provided that if the dust prevention and suppression
device of any machinery or equipment fails to operate efficiently, the operation of the said machinery or
equipment shall likewise cease and shall not be resumed until the defect therein has been rectified:
Provided further that, purely as a continency measure or as a secondary means of protection in a work
situation wherein it is technically not feasible to reduce the respirable dust concentration below the
‘permissible limit’ or during the time period necessary to instal and commission any device or to institute
any new work practice for dust prevention or suppression, compliance with the ‘permissible limit’ of dust
exposure may be achieved by remote operation or by job rotation and failing which by the use os a
respiratory equipment of a type specified from time to time by the Chief Inspector, by a general or special
order in writing in this behalf. (5) The owner, agent or manager or every mine where need of dust
respirators might arise shall – (a) ensure that, subject sot the second proviso to sub-regulation (4), no
person goes into or works or is allowed to go into or work at any place where the respirable dust
concentration is in excess of the ‘permisible limit’ unless he wears a suitable dust respirator; and (b)
Provide – (i) sufficient dust respirators of appropriate design at no costs to concerned work persons for
their use (ii) for the dust respirators to be regularly cleaned, disinfected and maintained in efficient
working order; and (iii) for the proper fitting of and for thorough training of the concerned workers in the
need for and correct use of respirators. (6) To prevent the liberation and accumulation of dust and the
propagation of airborne dust, the following provisions shall have effect, namely :- (a) dust shall be
suppressed as close as possible to its source of formation. (b) During any operation of drilling or boring on
surface or belowground - (i) the production of dust shall be reduced by using bits which are sharp and of
proper shape, by keeping suitable pressure on the bits and by keeping the h0les clear of the cuttings, (ii) a
jet of water shall be directed on to the cutting edge to wet the cuttings or other equally efficient device
approved by the Chief Inspector shall be provided and kept in operation throughout the drilling or boring
operation to prevent the atmosphere being charged with dust. Where pneumatic drilling is performed,
water shall be turned on before turning on compressed air to the drill. When, however, drilling is done by
hand, it shall be sufficient if holes are kept constantly moist during such drilling. (c) Roadways on surface
or below ground where mobile mining machinery ply shall be regularly wetted or shall be effectively
treated with some other equally efficient agent to reduce dust being raised in the atmosphere to a
minimum. (d) No plant for the screening or sorting of minerals or ores and as far as practicable, no heap of cinder, cement, sand, mortar or other dry and fine material shall be placed within 80 m. of the top of any
down -cast shaft or other intake airway not shall any such material be so handled as to make it air-borne
an drawn into such shaft or airway. (e) In every working belowground – (i) no machinery or equipment
which is likely to emit dust in excess of ‘permissible limit’ shall be operated unless it is equipped with a
suitable dust-prevention and suppression device and unless such device is operating efficiently ; (ii) work
places and rock walls in the vicinity thereof shall be, unless naturally wet throughout regularly washed
down to prevent accumulation of dust and shall be kept thoroughly wetted during work shifts; (iii) a
current of air sufficient to clear away the dust emitted by any machinery or operation and to dilute the
dust concentration below the ‘permissible limit’ shall be maintained by means of general ventilation and if
necessary, by local ventilation, so however that, as far as practicable, the velocity of air in any roadway or
workplace shall not be such as to raise dust in the atmosphere; (iv) after blasting, working places shall not
be entered, unless sufficient time has elapsed for dust, smoke and fumes to be cleared by a current of air
and the broken ore or rock shall not be moved unless it has been thoroughly wetted with water; (v)
vehicles, tubs and conveyors used for transport of mineral or ores shall be maintained in good condition
so as to minimise spillage or leakage and chutes, spiral conveyors, ore passes, bins, tipplers conveyor
discharge points and skip loading and unloading installations shall be so controlled as to reduce the

1000 m. A correction factor of 1.25 per cent per 100 m is to be applied for increasing the
clearance for altitude more than 1000 m and up to 3000 m; (2) The above safety working
clearances are based on an insulation height of 2.44 m which is the height of lowest point on
the insulator, where it meets the earthed metal, from the ground; (3) “Safety Working
Clearance” is the minimum clearance to be maintained in air between the live part of the
equipment on one hand and earth or another piece of equipment or conductor on which it
is necessary to carry out the work, on the other; (4) The “Highest System Voltage” is defined
as the highest rms phase to phase voltage which occurs under normal operating conditions
at any time and at any point of the system. It excludes voltage transients (such as those due
to system switching) and temporary voltage variations due to abnormal system conditions
(such as those due to fault conditions or the sudden disconnection of large loads). Schedule

interlocking scheme; 174 THE GAZETTE OF INDIA : EXTRAORDINARY [PART III—SEC.4] (2) The
above pole to earth clearances are for conductor-structure electrode configuration using gap
factor k equal to 1.35. (3) It is recognised that within a substation many different types of
electrode configurations shall be there with different values of k, therefore, the above
clearance shall be modified based upon the values of gap factor for a particular electrode
configuration subjected to the minimum ground clearance. (4) Clearance shall be provided
for electrical apparatus so that sufficient space is available for easy operation and
maintenance without any hazard to the operating and maintenance personnel working near
the equipment and for ensuring adequate ventilation. Schedule VII Part-A Form for reporting
