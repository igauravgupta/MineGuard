**MineGuard: AI-Powered Chatbot Integrated with Real-Time Incident Reporting for the Mining Industry**

---

## **Problem Statement**

The Indian mining industry operates under a highly complex and constantly changing regulatory framework, which includes:

- **Coal Mines Act, 1952**
- **Indian Explosives Act, 1884**
- **Coal Mines Regulations, 2017**
- Various **land-related laws** (CBA, LA, RandR)

Navigating these regulations can be challenging, leading to compliance risks, workplace hazards, and operational inefficiencies. There is a need for an intelligent system to provide real-time regulatory guidance, incident reporting, and comprehensive safety training.
